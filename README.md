# Predicting-Weather

## In this project I used the past six yeas daily temperatures of my city and predicted the next month temperatures.

In this project I collected the average temperatures of my city (Portland, Oregon) from the past 6 years (April 1st 2013 to Dec 31 2018) some of the strengths and weaknesses of regular logistic regression models and neural network models.
